This repository contains information and examples for implementing general-game-playing AIs
in Python, with a Java wrapper around them, such that they can subsequently be used
in the Java-based Ludii General Game System.

- For general information on implementing AIs for Ludii (not in Python), see: https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiExampleAI
- For general tutorials about Ludii, see: https://ludiitutorials.readthedocs.io

## Requirements

- Java version 8 or higher (including JDK)
- Python 3 (probably 3.6 or higher)

## Getting Started

TODO write instructions

## Citing Information

When using Ludii in any publications (for example for running experiments, or
for visual inspections of your agent's behaviour during development, etc.), 
please cite [our paper on the Ludii system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05013).
This can be done using the following BibTeX entry:

## Background Info

This repository contains information and examples for the development of Python-based
AI implementations, with a Java wrapper such that they can subsequently be loaded
into the Java-based Ludii General Game System.

This work, as well as the full Ludii system itself, are developed for the
Digital Ludeme Project. More info on the project and the system can be found on:
